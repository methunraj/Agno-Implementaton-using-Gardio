Each sheet should be named after the report section or table heading, matching the document (examples: 'Income Statement', 'Balance Sheet', 'Segment Information', 'Risk Table', 'Notes to FS - Table 4', etc). Maintain all original row/column structure and include all source footnotes, captions, and section headers in the appropriate positions for context. \n\nHeader Row Formatting: Bold, fill light gray (RGB 230,230,230), font size 11. Freeze top row in every sheet. Wrap text in all columns if content overflows. Maintain all cell alignments as close to original as possible. \n\nInsert a cover sheet named 'Extracted Sections Index' that lists every sheet name, the original page number/range, and a short description ('Income Statement â€“ p. 23 â€“ Consolidated company-wide income', etc). Do not perform or add any numerical calculations or analytics. The focus is pure, lossless data extraction and organization."

For the three core statements ('Income Statement', 'Balance Sheet', 'Cash Flow Statement'), create a second sheet with the same name plus ' Chart' (e.g. 'Income Statement Chart'), placing a default bar or line chart visualizing the table's top-level rows by year (with no extra calculations or commentaryâ€”just raw data charted as-is). \n\nAll other sheet formatting rules: Header row bold, pale blue fill (RGB 217,228,240), font 11. Freeze top row. Wrap text in all columns. Add a first sheet called 'Sections Directory' with a table listing all subsequent sheet names, their corresponding report page(s), and a short summary for user navigation. No calculated fields or analyticsâ€”output is strictly direct report extraction with optional reference charts only for core statements."
